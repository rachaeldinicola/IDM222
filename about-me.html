	<main class=aboutme>
		<p>I am a graduating senior at Drexel University majoring in Marketing and Business Analytics with a minor in Interactive Digital Media. I will be graduating early in March of 2018 and walking in the ceremony in June of 2018. I am passionate about using my creativity any time I get the chance, which is a nice balance to my data-driven, solution-finding character that I have discovered during my time at Drexel, as well as my 3 co-ops over the past few years. My creative and analytic skills are the reason I chose my combination of majors and minor, as they are the perfect combination for me to work in a career that I will find challenging, yet enjoyable. I hope to pursue a career in the digital marketing space, specifically in brand marketing, brand strategy, or creative strategy.</p>
