			<h2>Publicis Health Media</h2>
			<h3>Paid Search Associate</h3>
			<h4>September 2016 - Present</h4>			
			<p class=work>At Publicis Health Media, I worked as a Paid Search Associate (co-op). My tasks included analyzing SQR and Action Insight Reports to initiate new keyword, campaign, and ad group strategies and eliminate existing low-performing strategies; i.e. adding new negative keywords. I also performed ad copy analysis to discover optimizations to increase on-site engagement and CTR by recommending A/B ad copy or ad title tests to find optimal solutions. I spent a good amount of time building organized dashboards for the brands I work on, using queries pulling from DoubleClick and Google Analytics in Microsoft Excel to ensure quick and efficient monthly and quarterly reporting. Another one of my tasks included creating and uploading bulk sheets for new campaigns, ad groups, keywords, ads, sitelinks, and call-outs for easy upload into DoubleClick. Bi-weekly, I monitored competition to record new competitors entering into our brand landscapes and ensured the brands had high positioning and SOV.</p>

			<h3>Digital Marketing Co-op</h3>
			<h4>September 2015 - March 2016</h4>
			<p class=work>As Anthropologie&apos; Digital Marketing Co-op, I  assisted the email marketing team, as well as the SEO and Paid Search teams during my 6 month internship. I was responsible for steps along the lifecycle of Anthropologie&apos;s email program including calendar creation, daily reporting and analysis, and competitive monitoring. I generated weekly reports discussing and providing insights for 3-day metrics for the previous week&apos;s emails, including top products purchased, conversion rate, open rate, click-through rate, demand, etc. During the holiday season, I performed a deep-dive on Anthropologie and it&apos;s top competitorsâ€™ email imagery, design, text, and structure and presented the findings to discuss future plans and changes. Lastly, I assisted the SEO and Paid Search team by conducting keyword research using Google AdWords for new and existing products on website, updating title tags, and adding special hours on Google My Business during holiday for Anthropologie stores.</p></div>

			<p class=work>At Ballard Spahr, LLP, I was the Marketing Technology Co-op. I assisted the email communication team, as well as the even coordinator during my 6 month internship. My daily tasks consisted of data manipulation, analysis, and entry of data in InterAction, the firm-wide client relationship management (CRM) database.
